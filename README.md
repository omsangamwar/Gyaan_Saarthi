##  Problem Statement : Adaptive Laearning Pathways

## Project Title : 

## WHY of Gyan Sarthi :

Adaptive learning techniques are a beacon of hope for millions of individuals with disabilities worldwide. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), over one billion people, or approximately 15% of the global population, live with some form of disability. Among them, cognitive impairments affect a significant portion, hindering educational attainment and social inclusion. However, adaptive learning technologies offer a transformative solution, as evidenced by studies showing a 30% improvement in learning outcomes among students with disabilities who utilize such tools.

Beyond statistics, let's consider the human impact. Imagine the joy and pride felt by a dyslexic child as they read their first sentence independently using text-to-speech technology. Picture the sense of accomplishment radiating from a visually impaired student as they navigate through interactive learning modules, fully engaged and included. These emotions, coupled with tangible results, underscore the profound social benefit of embracing adaptive learning techniques. By investing in inclusive education, we not only empower individuals with disabilities to reach their full potential but also cultivate a more compassionate and equitable society for all.



## Description :
Our project is based on Adaptive Learning We are creating a Adaptive educational website i.e. website would adapt as per the user . We are focusing to cater our fellow friends with special abilities both major(Blindness,deaf,etc) and minor(congnative disabilities,adhd,dyslexia,etc) .This website will target on providing education keeping in mind the learning preferences of the users thus empowering them and helping them to enhance their skills.Our further aim would be create a model to  track attention retaining capacity of these individuals and thus enganging them with short activities to help them regain their intrest in ongoing lecture to enhance the learning.
